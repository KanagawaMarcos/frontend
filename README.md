# Welcome to my Frontend showcase

Hi! I'm **Marcos Costa** and currently **Frontend** developer. I use this repository to showcase some of my work, to study CSS and to drop some project that " I've done " following tutorials on youtube. 
So, if you want to see what I'm capable of, just look at the list bellow, pick up some project that you're interested in and enjoy!
## List

## Repository Structure
**Here's how it works**:  I don't like to unorganized code, so a separated this repository in 4 main folders; *CSS, Materialize, Bootstrap and Tutorials.*
1. To check my work without using any framework: **CSS**
2. To check my work using any framework: **Framework Name**
3. To check project that I've made following tutorials: **Tutorials**
